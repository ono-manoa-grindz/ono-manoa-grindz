The rice and beans were alright and nothing special. Their tacos were ok. They could use more flavoring and maybe add more moisture in it (kinda dry). I had them for lunch and for dinner I went over to my friends place for a taco bar party so I had tacos for both lunch and dinner. My friends tacos were far more tasty and I felt like I wasted my money on my lunch.

Don't get me wrong,  the food was super ono minus the fact that as many stated prior seemed like it was sitting on the counter for a while before they rang my buzzer. How did I know?  Noodles were on the softer side and the soup wasn't piping hot. We ordered both the beefy wild and a tan tan ramen. The broth to me on the Tan tan was WAY better than their number 1 ranked beefy wild ramen. I ordered the Tan Tan with an egg and extra noodles, delicious!  In the future I will probably add some meat to it as well. Kids liked their fried chicken too.",

Came in during lunch time which I expect to have been busy but it wasn't. However, the counter is literally 3 small steps from the door which is awkward. So if the line goes out the door, don't be alarmed, it's literally 5 feet from the entrance.. Wasn't feeling for my usual lemon chicken so I tried the grilled cheese sandwich and chili cheese fries. Both were really delicious! To top it off, I noticed the Ube dessert sign prior to ordering and completely forgot after ordering. Luckily the girl knew her promos and asked if I would like one order, yes of course! It wasn't too cold but the tart was perfectly moist. I prefer mines frozen but I didn't mind the softness. ",

I also always knew this place as Indian Cafe and did not know that they renovated or changed owners! I really like Indian food in general, especially the basics such as naan, tikka masala and biryani rice.",

As it was my first time, I wanted to try everything, so the owner/manager made me a special plate with a little of everything on it(see pic). I love how everything is so fresh and you feel healthy and full after you finish. I also had the mango lassi, which hit the spot! The authentic fresh food, friendly customer service were top notch for this gem on UH campus. Parking was at Kennedy theater. ",

Our server was tentative, took our order and made them right away. Then charged us later, it's the aloha spirit!  Don't forget to try their coffee too. I had an Americano and my friend had a French roast. Both just black and are amazing. So smooth, warm and full bodied. No need for cream or sugar.  We are coming back tomorrow and so excited to try other crepes!!",
